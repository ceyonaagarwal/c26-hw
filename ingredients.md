**BEST CHEESE FOR MAKING THE CHEESE FONDUE**

This easy fondue recipe uses the Swiss cheese and Gruyere cheese as bases, but for a different flavor profile, feel free to add blue cheese or another soft melt-able cheese and make a signature dip all your own! Make-ahead for a grab-and-go potluck or party! When it comes to choosing your own signature cheeses just make sure to choose soft, easy to melt cheeses with high-fat content for the best cheese fondue. Cheeses that have a deep rich flavor pair well with whatever your guests are dipping with.
