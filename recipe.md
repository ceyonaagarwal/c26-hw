**HOW TO MAKE CHEESE FONDUE??**

This cheese fondue is as easy as 1, 2, 3!!

1.Toss all of the shredded cheese with the cornstarch until the shreds are evenly coated.
2.Rub the inside of a stockpot (or fondue pot if you have one) with the peeled garlic clove that is cut in half.
3.Simmer wine in the pot and gradually add small handfuls of the coated cheese into the heated wine. Stir each handful in a figure 8 pattern until well melted. It is important to do this step slowly!
4.Stir in the remaining ingredients and continue to stir until heated through and the cheese is smooth and creamy.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1.Cut the clove of garlic in half and rub the inside of your saucepan with the garlic. Discard the clove (or save for another use).
2.Bring wine to a low simmer.
3.Toss all shredded cheeses with cornstarch. Set aside.
4.Reduce heat to medium low and add cheese a small handful at a time over low heat until melted. Stir in a figure 8 pattern until smooth before adding more. Do not try to rush this process or your cheese will not melt properly.
5.Stir in remaining ingredients (except bread) and heat through.
6.Serve warm with bread for dipping.

**CHEESE TIPS**

Always shred your own cheeses from a block. Pre-shredded cheeses have additives that can keep them from melting properly.

**VARIATIONS**

Add 1-2 teaspoons grainy mustard
Swap out the cheeses for your favorites (brie is amazing too)
Swap wine for beer (similar to a beer cheese dip!)
Darker beers, stouts, and malts will give a more bitter flavor while ales and IPAâ€™s will give a lighter flavor.
